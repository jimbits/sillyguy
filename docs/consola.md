**multiselect**

Allows the user to choose multiple options from a list using the spacebar.

1. password: Masks the input (typically with dots or asterisks) for sensitive data like API keys.

1. number: Restricts input to numerical values and often allows for a minimum and maximum range.

1. toggle: A simple binary switch (like On/Off) that is visually different from a standard confirm prompt.

1. box (Input): While usually for output, some configurations allow it to act as a structured multi-line text input.
